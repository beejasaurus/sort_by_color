# Sort By Color

Do you want to have a bunch of desktop wallpapers on rotate? Do you want to rotate them in an aesthetically pleasing color order?

This is a command line utility which will sort any folder of images into a color gradient. The color sorting algorithm is based on this post from Alan Zucconi:
http://www.alanzucconi.com/2015/09/30/colour-sorting/. The particular sort used is the Step sorting method.

## How to use this?

Clone this repository locally, navigate to this directory from the command line, then run `./sort_by_color.py`.

Type in the name of the directory you'd like to sort, e.g. ~/Documents/Wallpapers/Cars, then give it a moment to assess each image and prepend a sort number for
you.
